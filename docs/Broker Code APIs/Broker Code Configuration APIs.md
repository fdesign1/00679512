# Broker Code Configuration APIs

CoverForce also provides Broker Code CRUD APIs to aid in the management of Broker Codes. The Broker Codes are needed in the CoverForce application. 

A Broker Code configuration has the relevant appointment information that is required by each carrier to identify an agency and agent (some carriers). A Broker Code is required in order to generate quotes and bind them successfully.

Every unique Broker configuration can be identified by its `brokerConfigurationId`. The `brokerConfigurationId` needs to be set for each carrier in the application when creating the application. We do have an option to default the `brokerConfigurationId` based on the set-up of the API Client.

The Broker Code Configuration model definition can be viewed over here: [Broker Code Model](https://coverforce.stoplight.io/docs/coverforce-api/branches/main/9a4de8d1da9b6-broker-code)

The `configuration` field within the model has a unique structure for each carrier which can be found below. This is because each insurance carrier has different requirements/fields used to identify the appointment details with their agency partners.

>Creating and Updating Broker codes through the API is restricted for the following carriers: **Employers, CNA, GAIG, Markel, Coalition**. For these carriers, please reach out to us directly to set up the Broker Codes. This is because they require manual processes on the carrier's side.
