## Environments
We have a number of public environments to support you at different stages of your development and integration process.

ENVIRONMENT | ENDPOINT | DESCRIPTION
--- | --- | ---
Production | https://production.api.coverforce.com | For production use. Communicates with the production environments of our supported insurance institutions.
Sandbox | https://sandbox.api.coverforce.com | For development and testing. Generally behaves the same as production, but sends requests to non-production environments of our supported insurance institutions.
Mock Server | https://stoplight.io/mocks/coverforceapi/coverforceapi/7897565 | For viewing illustrative example responses only. No authentication is required, and requests have no side effects.
